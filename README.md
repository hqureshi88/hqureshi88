Hi, My name is Hamid and fairly new to coding ðŸ˜€ -  Iâ€™ve been doing this in my free time including a self-taught course using Codecademy with a couple of practical industry projects at the end to get me started as a full-stack developer. At the moment I am learning python by doing mini-projects on freecodecamp.com and recently signed up to STA (Scottish Tech Army) hoping to take on voluntary projects.

If you want to chat or have a coffee, feel free to drop me a line ðŸ˜¬.
