Hi, my name is Hamid and fairly new to coding ðŸ˜€ -  Iâ€™ve been doing this in my free time including a self-taught course using Codecademy with a couple of practical full-stack industry projects at the end. 

I am a full time electrical engineer by profession with a passion to learning coding and developing my skills. I recently joined STA (Scottish Tech Army) taking on voluntary projects and networking with people. Feel free to have a look at my github, any contributions will be very much appreciated!

If you want to chat and have a coffee, feel free to drop me a line ðŸ˜¬.

I particulalry enjoy Python (currently doing Udemy courses) as well as Javascript and C# - focussing on mastering OOP's a the moment!
