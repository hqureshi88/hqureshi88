Hi, My name is Hamid and fairly new to coding ðŸ˜€ -  Iâ€™ve been doing this in my free time including a self-taught course using Codecademy with a couple of practical industry projects at the end to get me started as a full-stack developer. 

At the moment I am a full time electrical engineer by profession (in case you maybe wondering why my github status is not looking busy). At the moment I am learning python by doing mini-projects on freecodecamp.com and recently signed up to STA (Scottish Tech Army) hoping to take on voluntary projects with the hope of networking with like minded people as well as developing my coding skills. 

If you want to chat and have a coffee, feel free to drop me a line ðŸ˜¬.
