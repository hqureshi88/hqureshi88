Hi, my name is Hamid and fairly new to coding ðŸ˜€ -  Iâ€™ve been doing this in my free time including a self-taught course using Codecademy with a couple of practical full-stack industry projects at the end. 

A self-taught software developer who recently had a career change from being an electrical engineer to a full stack developer. 
This profile is all my personal contributions including voluntary work as well as personal projects. Feel free to have a look at my github, any contributions will be very much appreciated!

My main stacks are React, Javascript, .NET/C# and little bit of PHP.

If you want to chat and have a coffee, feel free to drop me a line ðŸ˜¬.
